<h1>JAMStack</h1>
<p>The <strong>JAMStack</strong> is part of a family of techniques for creating sites called <code>serverless</code>, but those techniques can be a bit confusing.</p>
<p>In this course I'm going to show you how to create serverless sites using a static site generator called <strong>Eleventy</strong> and help you demystify the JAMStack.</p>
<p>We'll talk about what serverless is and why it can be faster and more secure than working with regular websites. We'll explore a <strong>node.js</strong> based platform called Eleventy that gives you a fantastic engine for creating JAMStack sites and apps.</p>
